# leaflet-challenge
Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from data set based on their longitude and latitude.


The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.


Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.


Create a legend that will provide context for map data.
